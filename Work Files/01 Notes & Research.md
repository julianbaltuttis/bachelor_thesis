# Notes & Research

## Argumentation

- Argumentation is a social activity

- The aim is to change the acceptability of a given standpoint.

- This is achieved by presenting arguments.

- There are four tasks undertaken by argumentation: identiﬁcation, analysis, evaluation and invention.

- More on argumentation can be found in [Rahwan (2009) - Argumentation in Artificial Intelligence.pdf](..\Assets\Rahwan (2009) - Argumentation in Artificial Intelligence.pdf)

- We will focus on the third task: Determining whether an argument is weak or strong by general criteria that can be applied to it.

### Informal Definition

> An argument is a set of statements (propositions), made up of three parts, a conclusion, a set of premises, and an infer-
> ence from the premises to the conclusion. An argument can be supported by other
> arguments, or it can be attacked by other arguments, and by raising critical questions
> about it. **Rahwan (2009): 2**

## Argumentation Graphs

- The concept of modelling arguments as graphs stems from  [Dung (1995) - On the Acceptability oF Arguments.pdf](..\Assets\Dung (1995) - On the Acceptability oF Arguments.pdf) 
- Argument diagrams can serve as a graphical tool to display premises and conclusions in an argument.
- Shows how groups of premises support conclusions that can in turn be used as premises in adjoining arguments.

### Informal Definition

> An argument diagram is essentially a box and arrow representation of an argument where the boxes con-
> tain propositions that are nodes in a graph structure and where arrows are drawn
> from nodes to other nodes representing inferences. **Rahwan (2009): 2**

### Argumentation Framework

- An argumentation-based formalism is called an **argumentation framework**.
- Deﬁned as a set of arguments, attacks amongst the arguments, and a semantics for evaluating the arguments.
- Also compare  [Amgoud (2016) - Evaluation of Arguments from Support Relations.pdf](..\Assets\Amgoud (2016) - Evaluation of Arguments from Support Relations.pdf) 

## Evaluation of graphs

- The concept of evaluating the overall strength of argumentation graphs stems from [Amgoud - Evaluation of Arguments from Support Relations.pdf](..\Assets\Amgoud - Evaluation of Arguments from Support Relations.pdf) .
- We use Semantics in order to evaluate Argumentation Graphs.
- Semantics must follow a set of axioms.
- This is the main part of our Bachelor Thesis.
