 [Amgoud - Evaluation of Arguments in Weighted Bipolar Graphs.pdf](..\Assets\Amgoud - Evaluation of Arguments in Weighted Bipolar Graphs.pdf) 

- Expands previous work that introduces Semantics that can deal with bipolar argumentation graphs.
- Covers arguments evaluation in weighted bipolar argumentation frameworks.
- Introduce axioms that a semantics could satisfy.
- Analyzes existing semantics based on axioms. 
- Proposes a new semantics for acyclic graphs.

#### TODO Should Conference# be part of quote?

Based on [Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence](https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.5555/3060621).

- Focuses on argumentation graphs.
- Introduces the concept of evaluating the overall strengths of arguments in such graphs
- Introduces a set of axioms that any semantics should satisfy. 
- Deﬁnes three semantics and evaluates them against the axioms.
- Presents the ﬁrst study on support argumentation graphs.
- The semantics introduced here do not work with bi-polar graphs

### Abstract Dialectical Frameworks

*of the Twelfth International Conference*, KR’10, 2010.

 [Brewka (2010) - Abstract Dialectical Frameworks.pdf](..\Assets\Brewka (2010) - Abstract Dialectical Frameworks.pdf) 

- Generalizes Dung-style argumentation frameworks as **dialectical frameworks**.
- Models support and attack dependencies.
- Generalizes Dung's standard semantics to be used for dialectical frameworks.
- Show how acceptance conditions can be represented using weights. 
- Demonstrates how some of the legal proof standards can be modeled based on this idea.

- Studies the fundamental mechanisms humans use in argumentation
- Introduces a theory that defines the acceptability of arguments.
- Shows that logic programming and nonmonotonic reasoning in AI are different forms.
- Shows that argumentation is a special form of logic programming.
- Results in a general method for generating metainterpreters for argumentation systems.
